  ## Description
  Having a hard time focusing while you're working or studying? Want to get more done? Use the Pomodoro Technique!

  The Pomodoro Technique is a method that breaks your work sessions into 25-minute intervals, with a small break in between. These breaks are typically 5 minutes.

  Breaking your work up into 25-minute sessions is long enough to get work done, but also short enough to feel like a break isn't too far away.

  So, put your phone down, open this app, and enjoy some productivity!
